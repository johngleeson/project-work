# project-work
Repo containing some work I've done throughout my degree.

#### Bash
Scripts I wrote for a Linux module

#### C
Small programs demonstating Linux system programming using semaphores / threads etc.

#### Embedded C
An Arduino project to cycle through LEDs.  
Written in pure C.

#### Java
One file is my solution to the "Max Vector" problem.  
There is also a simple shift cipher program.

#### Malware Scanner - My Final Year Project

A rudimentary malware scanner written primarily in Node.js / Javascript. It consists of a client/server and requires an SQL 
database to operate properly.

It performs quite well:
- 30GB / 17k files in 7 minutes
- The server can process multiple clients
- The system is capable of detecting real, live malware

In it's current state on this repo, it DOES NOT function. This is due to the missing 4GB database.  
If you want to see it functioning or would like the accompanying report, feel free to contact me.  

#### PHP
The web front-end to a movie rental project.  
Not pretty but it works.
