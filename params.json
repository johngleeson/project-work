It consists of a client/server and requires an SQL \r\ndatabase to operate properly, which is not on this repo.\r\n\r\nIt performs quite well:\r\n- 30GB / 17k files in 7 minutes\r\n- The server can process multiple clients\r\n- The system is capable of detecting real, live malware\r\n\r\nIf you want to see it functioning or would like the accompanying report, feel free to contact me.  \r\n\r\n#### Node.js Forensics Tool\r\nA forensics tool to read the MBR of an imaged disk.  \r\nAlso displays information about deleted files contained within the image.\r\n\r\n#### PHP\r\nThe web front-end to a movie rental project.  \r\nNot pretty but it works.\r\n",
